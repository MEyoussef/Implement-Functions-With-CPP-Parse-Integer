# Implement-Functions-With-CPP-Parse-Integer

/**
 * This function takes a string as input and performs one of three operations based on user input.
 * The operations are uppercase, lowercase, and swapcase.
 *
 * The function asks the user to input an operation, and then iterates over each character in the input string.
 * For each character, it checks the operation and performs the appropriate operation.
 *
 * If the operation is 'uppercase', it checks if the character is lowercase. If it is, it converts it to uppercase.
 * If it is already uppercase, it prints a message saying that the uppercase character will be ignored.
 *
 * If the operation is 'lowercase', it checks if the character is uppercase. If it is, it converts it to lowercase.
 * If it is already lowercase, it prints a message saying that the lowercase character will be ignored.
 *
 * If the operation is 'swapcase', it converts the character to the opposite case (uppercase if it is lowercase, lowercase if it is uppercase).
 *
 * Finally, it returns the resulting string.
 *
 * @param str The string to be processed.
 * @return The resulting string after the operation.
